    <!-- Anchor element test to make a clickable link -->
    <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click me!</a>
    <!-- if there is no href attribute the text will look like plain text -->
    <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click me!</a>
    <!-- href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened -->
    <!-- rel attributed is used to describe the relaiton between current page and linked doc
    noopener value prevents the opened link from gaininig access to the webpage from which i twas opened
    noreffer prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it
    We do this to orevent phishing attacks where the opened link may change to a different one to trick users
